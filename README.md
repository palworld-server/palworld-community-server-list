# palworld-community-server-list
I would like to introduce you to our PalWorld server list https://palserver.com/.

At https://palserver.com/ we offer PalWorld server operators the opportunity to promote their servers free of charge and make them more visible to players and the community.

You can easily create your server with us and enter important information such as the IP address, your Discord and your website.

We also offer Rcon features so that your live player numbers can be tracked.

We would be delighted if you would add your server to our list!
